NOTES
==== 12/11/2016
1. Entrance:
   - 50% movement from the last opposite wave in 123 pattern (in a 3rd wave)
2. Exit:
   - if movement is faster then the BO-wave, then wait for one more wave
   - if movement is slower than the BO-wave, then Exit at the End-price of the BO-wave (if trendline goal is achieved)
   - reached goal of the oppposite trendline which occurred after the order
3. Stop-loss:
   - for the length of the oppsite wave from the current high/low of the carrier wave
   - when the carrier wave hits high of the breakout wave, SL is set to the order vertex
   - 
4. Waves:
   - trendline give levels
   - trendline give waves with different length and fixed vertexes!!! Trendline rule!!!

Base 2 Major Timeframes:
M1->M15 (x15)
M5->M60 (x12)
M15->M240 (x16)
!!!!!!! Waves in a trendline must differ no more than 2x times

RETRACE WAVE consists of Trendlines CASCADE
Cascade of impulses embraces cascade of cascades of trendlines
To enter:
- we need snowball effect from the BO retest of the trendline which we use to enter
- RR from the enter BO trendline must no less the x5
STOP:
- Don't place stop under low/high - instead, place stop according to RR 2:1
  minimum




==== 24/10/2016 ==== 
Time period - where to find trendlines cascade - were the next lower low / higher high is located
	- this is because under Sperandeo rule you can't draw another trendline - if the way gets nullified
	  the end vertex of such wave cannot be a trendline vertex - this wave end CAN BE ONLY A START FOR TRENDLINE CASCADE 

Included cascades of trendlines. Each cascade is the correction wave of a impulse

The beginning of an INNER CASCADE must be in the wave_end of breakout wave of the trendline of the OUTER CASCADE

If distance from the lowest price of the INNER CASCADE to the earliest trendline of the OUTER CASCADE - then that trenline very possible to be broke out

LEVEL:
is vertex (and the corresponding corrector) of trendline. This vertex may be a rewritten one, but in this case it must be in the center of the trendline
